                    <h2>The Overview</h2>
                        <p>The objective for this project was download a unity environment and add multiple layers of interaction.
                            The first part of interaction that was needed was the player movement. This consisted of adding a script 
                            onto an object connected to a camera, so the player would be able to control and walk around with the camera. 
                            The second part of interaction we needed was to create a setting menu which would house buttons and switches that, when 
                            toggled, would change parts of the environment. The third and last part of interaction that we needed was 
                            to be able to interact with 3 specific objects in our environment. Upon clicking these objects, something 
                            needed to change in the environment. The project was successful since I was able to add in all types of interaction.

                        <p>I was tasked with adding interaction to a virtual reality unity environment. Over a span of 7 weeks we learned the basics 
                            of unity, and were then tasked with creating a final environment in the last 3 weeks of the term.</p>

                        <p>This project exists to experiment with unity environments and interactions. The project as a whole seeks to explore the 
                            possibilities of vr and xr environments.

                        <p>The target audience for this project is anyone who enjoys viewing and interacting with vr or xr environments. Contrary to popular belief, 
                            you do not need a vr headset to enjoy environments. Instead, you can enjoy them from the comfort of your laptop or desktop.

                            <h3>Process</h3>
                            <p>To start off the process of creating the final product, I first had to find a unity environment that I liked. 
                                This was easy, as the unity store has a good amount of fun environments to choose from. I ended up choosing a 
                                dungeon-esque environment, and picked a singular room which I would add the interaction to.
                            </p>
                            <p>The first step was to add camera control to the environment. This involved placing a camera on a rectangle which 
                                was about the same height as a person would be in the environment, and adding code in order to give the player 
                                the ability to move the rectangle around with their keyboard and mouse. Since there is a camera attached the top of 
                                the rectangle, the player can see where they are moving: player movement successfully completed.
                            </p>
                            <p>The second step was to add a settings menu that would house a button which would allow the player to turn the background music on or off, a volume 
                                slider which would allow players to turn down or up the music, as well as a button which would turn off the chandelier lights on the ceiling. 
                                This was pretty simple, as button and sliders in unity are able to adjust different aspects of the environment without the developer ever 
                                having to touch code. In my instance, I didn't have to touch code. I simply dragged and dropped elements onto their corresponding interactions, 
                                and they worked: settings menu successful.
                            </p>
                            <p>The third and final step was to add interaction to 3 objects of my choosing. In order to do this, normally developers would have to 
                                play around and experiment with code, but I found a work around. Instead of coding the interactions, I added a script to the objects I 
                                wanted to interact with. This script basically turned the objects into buttons, meaning I didn't have to worry about messing around 
                                with code, and could instead use the same method as before to add interaction. After dragging and dropping elements onto their corresponding 
                                interactions, I was finished: interactable objects successful.

                        <p>The solution to this project is the completed unity environment with it's corresponding interactions. Once the 
                            interactions were fully integrated, this project could be deemed successful.

                    <p>Overall, Iâ€™d say that this project was a success. I accomplished what I set out to do, which was to add interaction to a unity
